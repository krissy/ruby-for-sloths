    <h1>Introduction to Coding Concepts using Ruby (and sloths).</h1>
    <div id="container" class="col">
      <h2>Hellooooo, worlddddd.</h2>
      <p>This workshop is given by software engineer Kriselda Rabino for <a href="http://acornhackgirls.co.uk">AcornHack:Girls</a> 2016, a unique hackathon involving young female entrepreneurs aged 12-19 in celebration of International Women's Day (in partnership with Ada's List, Girls In Tech, GeekGirls Meetup, Geekettes, Blooming Founders and UnLtd).</p>
      <p>It introduces basic coding concepts using Ruby, and has a few too many sloth analogies in it due to Kris' unhealthy obsession with these slow, amusing creatures.</p>
      
      <h2>What we'll cover:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>So, who's this Ruby kid anyway?</li>
        <li>What's a program?</li>
        <li>Playing with Ruby.</li>
        <li>Mistakes are inevitable; accept them, embrace them. (aka Errors are your new BFF)</li>
        <li>What does 'Object-Oriented' mean? How to think in things and classes.</li>
        <li>Ruby's basic data types: numbers and strings and arrays, oh my!</li>
        <li>Methods and madness.</li>
        <li>Variables = "super handy"</li>
        <li>Decisions, decisions. Conditional Statements are here to help.</li>
        <li>Iterating over collections (now it's getting a bit loopy)</li>
        <li>Your turn! Let's make some code.</li>
      </ol>
      
      ENJOY, CODEMAKERS!
